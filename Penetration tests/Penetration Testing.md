# Penetration Testing
---

### 1. *[[Information Gathering & Reconnaissance]]* :
- #### Reconnaissance is the Act of Gathering Information about your target to better plan out your attack, And this type is the only one that can be preform on any Website or Target that you want.
---
- #### Two Ways that we can go about doing Information Gathering :
	1) #Active by directly interacting with our Target.
	2) #Passive without any kind of interact.

---

### 2. *[[Scanning]]* :
- From Here you can get into trouble if you do it without Permission.

- Scanning is a Deeper Form of Information Gathering, using Technical Tools to find openings in the Target and in the system that you're attacking (Gateways, Open Ports, Operating Systems) that the Target always run.

---
- Also Preform Vulnerability Scanning, which is just searching for Vulnerable Software in the Target System or Network that could possibly be #exploit. 
---
### 3. *[[Gaining Access & Exploitation]]* :
- This step is where you actually Hack the Target, we use the Info Gathered in phase #Information-gathering and #scanning to take control of any number of Target Devices

- Gaining Access allow to steal Data from their System or to use these Devices to Attack other devices on the same Network.

---
- After this Step, you can consider Penetration Tests to be successful since you manage to gain Access to a Target System.
---

### 4. *[[Maintaining Access]]* :
- Maintaining Access is important step and commonly done by installing #Backdoor and planting #Rootkits.

- They are simply Programs that will allow us to gain access to that Target whenever we want without the need to exploit it again.

---

### 5. *[[Covering Tracks]]* :
- It is simply removing all Evidence that an Attack ever took place.

- This can involve deleting, hiding files, editing logs or basically reverting any changes that you did to the System while Attacking.
